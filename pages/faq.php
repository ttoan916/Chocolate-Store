                    <div class="question">What is the caffeine level in your products?</div>
                    <div class="answer">Caffeine is a compound naturally found in commonly consumed items such as coffee, tea, and chocolate. An average cup of coffee (8 fl oz) contains about 95 mg and the same amount of tea contains about 26 mg. Compared to these two sources chocolate has very little caffeine. The caffeine content of chocolate is dependent on the amount of cacao in the product. Dark chocolate contains about 20 mg of caffeine per ounce, milk chocolate contains about 6 mg per ounce, and white chocolate contains no caffeine. However, caffeine content will vary and can be dependent on the cocoa bean type and origin.</div>

                    <div class="question">Can I use a debit card?</div>
                    <div class="answer">Yes, we accept debit cards as a form of payment. However, please note that we authorize debit cards and credit cards at the point of sale but we do not charge your card until your order has shipped. This can be mistaken for double billing and may impact your available balance. Each financial institution is different. Please refer to the issuing bank of your debit card for their specific authorization processes. We are more chocolate experts, they are more money people.</div>
